# Brazilian Stocks API

A full on API for more than 40 fundamentalist data in the Brazillian Stock Market, using an API Key system to deliver amazing performance and usuability for our users.

Built for commercial use and to the [Mansa](https://github.com/mansa-team) project and possibly Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prompting.

Objectives:
 - Create an API that have actual API keys
 - Be able to customize things such as the port that the service will operate, mantaining the alignment with the modularity proposed by the Mansa Project
 - Quick and customizable queries from my MySQL database formatted in JSON for ease of use
